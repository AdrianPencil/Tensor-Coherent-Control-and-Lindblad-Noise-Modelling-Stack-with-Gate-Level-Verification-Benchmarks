\section{Verification and validation}

\subsection{Verification}

Verification answers: did we implement the math we intended?

This is primarily addressed by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item unit tests in \texttt{tests/}
  \item invariants such as trace preservation and unitarity checks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Validation}

Validation answers: does the model predict reality?

\qip{} includes case studies with measured-ish inputs (PSD, calibration) as a
structure for validation, but the physical mapping from inputs to rates and
Hamiltonians is intentionally lightweight in the initial scaffold.
