\section{Device adapters}

Device adapters provide a stable boundary between physics models and workflows.

A device is expected to provide:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a drift Hamiltonian,
  \item a control Hamiltonian construction given calibration,
  \item optional effective noise rates for early Lindblad modeling.
\end{itemize}

This keeps case studies and pipelines uniform across platforms such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item superconducting qubits
  \item trapped ions
  \item neutral atoms
  \item photonics (dual-rail)
\end{itemize}
