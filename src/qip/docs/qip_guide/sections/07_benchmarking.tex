\section{Benchmarking}

\qip{} includes a small benchmarking layer intended for regression tests and
quick validation loops.

\subsection{Fidelity}

For pure states:
\[
F(\ket{\psi},\ket{\phi}) = |\braket{\psi}{\phi}|^{2}.
\]

For density matrices, \qip{} uses the Uhlmann fidelity:
\[
F(\rho,\sigma) = \Bigl(\Tr\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho}\sigma\sqrt{\rho}}\Bigr)^{2}.
\]

\subsection{Gate benchmarking}

For unitary gates, a process fidelity proxy is used:
\[
F_{p}(U,V) = \frac{|\Tr(U^{\dagger}V)|^{2}}{d^{2}}.
\]
From this a standard average infidelity proxy is computed.
