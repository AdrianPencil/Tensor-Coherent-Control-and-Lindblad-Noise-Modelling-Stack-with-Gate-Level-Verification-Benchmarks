\section{Case study: superconducting qubit end-to-end}

This case study demonstrates an integration path:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item load calibration values and a measured noise PSD,
  \item fit a simple PSD model (1/f plus white),
  \item map PSD to effective rates $(\gamma_{\phi}, \gamma_{1})$,
  \item build a Lindblad model,
  \item simulate a short driven evolution intended to implement an $X$ gate,
  \item evaluate density fidelity against the ideal target.
\end{enumerate}

The physics mapping is a scaffold intended to be replaced by a device-derived model.
The value of the case study is that it is end-to-end, typed, and regression-testable.
