\section{Noise stack}

Noise is represented in two complementary ways:

\subsection{Spectral view}

\texttt{noise.spectra} provides PSD models $S(\omega)$ with $\omega$ in rad/s.
\texttt{noise.identification} provides a small fitter for a 1/f plus white model.

\subsection{Channel view}

\texttt{noise.channels} provides Kraus-channel constructors for common 1-qubit noise.

\subsection{Effective-rate view}

\texttt{noise.models} provides pragmatic mapping from PSD to effective rates.
These mappings are scaffolds intended to be replaced by device-derived formulas.
