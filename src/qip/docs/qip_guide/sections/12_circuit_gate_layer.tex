\section{Circuit and gate layer}

The circuits layer provides:
\begin{itemize}
  \item gate objects with explicit qubit indices and dense matrices
  \item a circuit container for composition
  \item tensor-based simulation for statevectors and density matrices
\end{itemize}

This layer is not intended to be only a gate library -it is a stable abstraction
boundary that can later be transpiled into device-native pulse descriptions.
