\section{Performance}

This project aims to remain dependency-light and to rely on efficient NumPy
kernels.

Key practices:
\begin{itemize}
  \item prefer contiguous arrays for BLAS-friendly operations
  \item avoid constructing full $2^{n}\times 2^{n}$ matrices per gate where possible
  \item keep core routines small enough to profile and replace
\end{itemize}

For large-scale simulations, the recommended strategy is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item use the circuit tensor backend for gate-level simulation,
  \item use Lindblad solvers for small open-system models,
  \item introduce sparse or GPU backends only when the workload demands it.
\end{itemize}
