\section{Scope}

\qip{} is a modular, minimal codebase intended to support:

\begin{itemize}
  \item states (pure and mixed),
  \item operators (dense and light sparse),
  \item dynamics (Hamiltonian and Lindblad),
  \item noise models (PSD, channels, identification),
  \item control scaffolding (pulses, calibration, light optimization),
  \item circuits (gates, composition, simulation),
  \item concrete case studies that connect these layers end-to-end.
\end{itemize}

This guide focuses on API structure and reproducible pipelines, not full-blown device-level accuracy.
The intent is that you can replace or refine any modeling component without rewriting the stack.
